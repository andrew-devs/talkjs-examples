This is an example project for TalkJS's tutorial on how to make clickable tabs for conversations.

The project uses TalkJS's [custom message actions
](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/Chatbox/#Chatbox__onCustomMessageAction) to add a new "Open Tab" option to each message a user sends in the chatbox UI. If the "Open Tab" option is clicked for a given message, a tab gets created and the chatbox switches to a private conversation between you and the user who sent the message. Use these new tabs to navigate between conversations.
